## Trademark notice

"Snowplow" is a trademark of Snowplow Analytics Ltd. References to Snowplow,
the Snowplow protocol, the Snowplow JavaScript tracker, and Iglu Central in
this project's documentation are **nominative fair use** to describe
interoperability and the origin of third-party components. This project is
**not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by Snowplow Analytics Ltd.**

The licenses above (BSD 3-Clause, Apache 2.0) cover copyright in the source
code. Per BSD-3-Clause clause 3 and Apache-2.0 §6, those licenses do **not**
grant any rights to use the names, trademarks, or logos of the original
authors, and this project does not claim any such rights.

## Redistribution checklist for downstream packagers

If you build and distribute a Docker image, tarball, or other artifact that
**bundles** the JS tracker, plugin files, or Iglu schemas alongside this
project's code, you must also redistribute:

1. This `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` file, **and**
2. The Apache 2.0 license text shipped with Iglu Central (`LICENSE` file
   inside the `iglu-central` submodule), **and**
3. The original BSD-3-Clause copyright headers embedded in `sp.js`,
   `loader.js`, and each plugin bundle (these are preserved as comments at
   the top of every JS file — do **not** strip them during minification).

If you only redistribute this repository's source (without the bundled
`static/` artifacts and without recursing the submodule), only this file
needs to travel with it.
